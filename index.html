    <img src="images/pic18.png" alt="HAPPY BEGUM" width="25%" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
    <p style="color:blue; text-align:center;"><strong>This is my Begum, AKA as my baby princess</strong></p>

    
    <h2 style="text-align:center; color:blueviolet;">RULES BY BEGUM</h2>
    <img src="images/pic12.png" alt="SHE WANTS ICECREAM ALL THE TIME" width="25%"  style="display:block; margin:auto;">
    <p style="color:blue; text-align:center;"><strong>Since the day we met, she always loved icecream specifically from SOFTSWIRL. Just like a child she'll take minimum of 20 mins to decide which flavour she wants or what kind she wants. But none the less, the smile after that icecream and that happiness is all I crave for.</strong></p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:goldenrod;">AMAZING USE OF HER CREATIVE YET CHILDISH (cute) MIND</h3>
    
    <img src="images/pic3.png" alt="MY INITIAL PET NAMES" width="25%"  style="display:block; margin:auto;">
    <p style="color:blue; text-align:center;"><strong>So it is a funny story, I used to act all immature and dumb in front of her so that she might laugh upon my dumb and foolish acts, but who knew those acts ended up naming me all this ;).</strong></p>
    
    <img src="images/pic4.png" alt="BEGUM WANTS ATTENTION" width="25%" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
    <p style="color:blue; text-align:center;"><strong> Yeah Man! She wants attention all the time, which kinda makes her more cute TBVH. Atleast once in a day she'll act that she is naraz and all and wants me "KEH MEIN USSE MANAO" and that too with extra love, well you gotta do thatfor your wife.</strong></p>
    
    <img src="images/pic13.png" alt="SHE SLEEPS LIKE A BEAR IN WINTER SEASON" width="25%" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
    <p style="color:blue; text-align:center;"><strong>Nah man, if I sleep it'll be my last day on planet earth, but if she sleeps so what, she'll get away by saying : "MEIN TOH AAPKA BACHA HOON NA", like WTF, but now yeah I got her undercontrol ahahahahahahah.</strong></p>
    
    <img src="images/pic14.png" alt="SAD REALITY" width="25%" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
    <p style="color:blue; text-align:center;"><strong>Maybe this line will portray the feelings after spending the whole day together : "TERE AANE KI KHUSHBO, TERE JAANE KA MANZAR, TJHE MILNA PARE GA AB ZAMANA HUA".</strong></p>

    <p style="color:blue; text-align:center;"><strong>Yeah I do make jokes about it, like uncle refund krdo buhat dimagh khaati hai aapki beti, but the truth is It'll be my bad luck if I ever think of replacing her cause she's a rare diamond and I dont know how on earth she came in my life, so yeah I LOVE HER AS SHE IS.</strong></p>

    <p style="color:maroon; text-align:center;">Now she is also a major part of my goals</p>
    <p style="color:orangered; text-align:center;">Well, after passing time with her, after getting to know her I made my decision that she was the best wife a man could ever wish for and that I'm so blessed to have her in my life, and that how she takes care of me, how she treats me, how she makes sure of everything just like the best wife should, so yeah she's all I have and all I want.</p>
